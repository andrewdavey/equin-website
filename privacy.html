					<h2>Who we are</h2>

					<h2>Insight’s Purpose</h2>
					<p>
						Insight is an online assessment tracking tool. Since 2007,
						Insight has enabled schools to record staff, pupil and assessment data for the
						purpose of attainment and progress monitoring.
					</p>
					<p>
						We place a high value on delivering an excellent experience
						for our customers. To us, this means working hard to create a product which is
						simple to use, genuinely helpful and well supported.
					</p>
					<p>
						We’re committed to achieving sustainable growth. This means seeking
						to grow Insight’s customer base, together with the Equin Ltd team, at a rate
						that doesn’t result in having to compromise on the quality of the customer’s
						experience. This kind of growth benefits our customers, who can feel reassured
						that our established business is here to stay.
					</p>
					<h2>Our Data Protection Philosophy</h2>
					<p>
						As a school, you are the Data Controller in respect of the
						personal data you store on Insight, and Equin Ltd is the Data Processor. We
						collect personal information as a Data Controller as well, in order to operate our
						business.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your data is yours. At all times we aim to respect any
						personal data you share with us, or that we receive from other organisations,
						and keep it safe.
					</p>
					<p>
						We never sell personal information, and we’re committed to treating
						your data only in ways you’d expect. When we use third parties to help us
						deliver our services and products, we take care to ensure those third parties
						are equally committed to safeguarding your privacy.
					</p>
					<p>
						We aim at all times to promote a positive culture around
						data protection and security. Our policies and processes are under constant
						review.
					</p>
					<h2>About this Privacy Notice</h2>
					<p>
						This Privacy Notice (“Notice”), together with our <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>
						and any other documents referred to within, sets out our data collection and
						processing practices and your options regarding the ways in which your personal
						information is used.  It applies to information we collect about:

						offer additional services and may update this Notice accordingly. If we need to
						make changes to how we process and use your personal information, we will
						update this Notice and keep you informed where appropriate.
					</p>

					<p>
						We use Google Analytics, a third party service, to monitor
						anonymised data about visitors to <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com">https://www.insighttracking.com</a>.

						above, and to assess the effectiveness of our marketing. This information is
						only processed in a way which does not identify anyone.

					<h2>Information we collect as a Data Controller</h2>
					<p>
						We collect certain personal information in our capacity as a
						Data Controller, in order to run our business. We collect information:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							1. When you give it to us directly <br>
						</b><br>
						When you get in touch with us, either to make an enquiry about Insight, start a
						free trial, open an Insight account or seek support, we store personal
						information which may include your name, phone number and email address. Your means
						of contacting us may be via email, telephone, post or through an online social
						media service such as Twitter or Facebook.<br>
						<br>
						We may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, your
						school, and any trusts or other groups that your school may belong to. This may
						include your position at your school, the school’s and/or trust’s name, contact
						and DfE details. Non-personally identifiable information by itself cannot be
						used to identify or contact you. However, this information may be combined with
						other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified.<b>
							<br>
							<br>
							Purpose
						</b>: We use this information to address and keep track of enquiries about
						Insight, administer Insight accounts and free trials, and to deliver ongoing
						support to customers in a timely and effective manner, in line with our general
						purpose outlined above.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Lawful basis for processing</b>: “Contract”. This processing is necessary
						for us to deliver our contracts with the schools and trusts who use Insight, or
						to take the required steps to address enquiries prior to entering into a
						contract.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Purpose</b>: We may occasionally use this information for direct marketing
						purposes, to let you know about new products, tools and services we offer,
						where these are similar in scope to those of our products, tools and services
						you currently use. Any such contact will be made in line with applicable law,
						including the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/legislation-we-cover/privacy-and-electronic-communications-regulations/">
							Privacy
							and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)
						</a>, and in line with our
						general purpose outlined above.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Lawful basis for processing</b>: “Legitimate Interests”. This processing is
						necessary as part of our efforts to grow our business. We take the same care
						over personal information collected this way as over any personal information
						we store. If we do contact you, we’ll always give you an upfront opportunity to
						opt out from future contact.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Right to Object:</b> You have the right to object to the processing of your
						personal information collected under this lawful basis. Please see the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/">
							ICO’s
							guidance
						</a> for more information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Retention</b>: We retain personal information collected this way for up to
						12 months following any enquiries, or for as long as your school is a customer
						of or has a free trial of Insight, or indefinitely as required to keep track of
						requests not to be contacted. After an Insight account is closed we retain personal
						information where reasonably necessary to resolve disputes, enforce our <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, meet
						regulatory requirements, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or comply
						with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests). Where none of
						these obligations apply, your personal information will be deleted within 12
						months of your account being closed. Non-personally identifiable information
						about you, your school, and any trusts or other groups that your school may
						belong to may be retained indefinitely.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							2. When it
							is available publicly<br>
							<br>
						</b>We may collect publicly available information about you and your school
						which is available from external sources, including the government’s <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/">
							Get Information About
							Schools
						</a> service and school or trust websites. Personal information
						collected this way may include your name, phone number and email address. This
						may be combined with non-personally identifiable information about you, your
						school, and any trusts or other groups that your school may belong to,
						including your position at your school, the school’s and/or trust’s name,
						contact and DfE details.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Purpose</b>: We use this information for direct marketing purposes, in order
						to keep track of people and organisations who may be interested in Insight, and
						to contact people and organisations where appropriate in line with applicable
						law, including the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/legislation-we-cover/privacy-and-electronic-communications-regulations/">
							Privacy
							and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)
						</a>, and in line with our
						general purpose outlined above.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Lawful basis for processing:</b> “Legitimate Interests”. This processing is
						necessary as part of our efforts to grow our business. We take the same care
						over personal information collected this way as over any personal information
						we store. If we do contact you, we’ll always give you an upfront opportunity to
						opt out.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Right to Object:</b> You have the right to object to the processing of your
						personal information collected under this lawful basis. Please see the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/">
							ICO’s

						</a> for more information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Retention</b>: We retain personal information collected this way for up to
						12 months following any contact, or for as long as your school is a customer of
						or has a free trial of Insight, or indefinitely as required to keep track of
						requests not to be contacted. Non-personally identifiable information about
						you, your school, and any trusts or other groups that your school may belong to
						may be retained indefinitely.
					</p>
					<h2>Information we collect as a Data Processor</h2>
					<p>
						When you use Insight, either as a customer or during a free
						trial period, you are the Data Controller in respect of any data you store in
						Insight (“Customer Data”). Our <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> (“Agreement”)
						constitute a written contract between us which allows us to act as your Data
						Processor in compliance with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/">
							General
							Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
						</a>. The Agreement contains the specific information
						you need to know about:
					</p>
					<ul class=bullet>
						<li>What personal information can be processed in Insight;</li>
						<li>How and where we store that personal information;</li>
						<li>Which sub-processors we use to deliver Insight.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Purpose</b>: We process Customer Data to deliver our Agreement
						with the schools and trusts who use Insight. This involves storing Customer
						Data, importing, exporting, modifying and deleting Customer Data where
						instructed by you to do so, and accessing Customer Data for the purposes of
						offering support.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Lawful basis for processing</b>: “Contract”. This processing is necessary
						for us to deliver the Agreement.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Retention</b>: You may at any time delete or export, or ask us to delete or
						export, any Customer Data that you no longer require us to process. Otherwise,
						Customer Data is retained until our Agreement terminates, and will be deleted
						within 30 days of that termination.
					</p>
					<h2>Sharing and Access to Personal Information</h2>
					<h3>Sub-processors</h3>
					<p>
						We use carefully selected processors and sub-processors to
						deliver Insight and to operate our business. These third parties supply the
						infrastructure, storage and associated services necessary for us to provide Insight.
						We have entered into GDPR-compliant, written contracts with our processors and sub-processors,
						and where our use of these third parties entails the transfer of personal
						information outside the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;) to the United
						States, have chosen sub-processors which are certified under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">
							EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
							Frameworks
						</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see the specific sub-processors used for the purpose
						of processing your Customer Data in the <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.
						Where we see a need to add a new sub-processor to those specified, we will
						first notify you to explain our purposes, and you will have the opportunity to
						object.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may use additional processors to process data in our
						capacity as a Data Controller.
					</p>
					<h3>Your Authorised Users</h3>
					<p>
						Any employees, agents and independent contractors that
						you add to your Insight staff list will have access to your Customer Data
						(“Authorised Users”). It is your responsibility to maintain your list of
						Authorised Users, for example by removing staff who have left the school. We
						accept no liability for un-authorised access where Authorised Users have not
						been removed from your staff list.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since Insight is an online service accessible via the
						Internet, Authorised Users may access Insight from outside the UK or EEA. In
						such cases, a transfer of your Customer Data outside the EEA may be deemed to
						have occurred. You are responsible for ensuring that Authorised Users access your
						account in a secure and responsible way.
					</p>
					<h3>Our Authorised Company Employees</h3>
					<p>
						Authorised employees of Equin Ltd may have access to your personal
						information and Customer Data. This enables us to offer timely, helpful
						support when you contact us. Company employees are trained to follow our data
						protection policies at all times and sign strict confidentiality agreements
						when they join the company.
					</p>
					<h3>Third Parties as Legally Required</h3>
					<p>
						We may disclose personal information to third parties in
						order to:
					</p>
					<ul class=bullet>
						<li>comply with any legal obligation</li>
						<li>enforce our <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></li>
						<li>prevent fraud</li>
						<li>resolve disputes</li>
						<li>protect the rights or safety of ourselves or our customers</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Third Parties in the Event of a Sale of Business</h3>
					<p>
						If Equin Ltd or substantially all of its assets are sold,
						whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation,
						or other transaction or proceeding, your personal information may be shared
						with any acquiring organisation and their representatives, and your personal
						information and Customer Data may be one of the transferred assets. In this
						event you will be notified.
					</p>
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>
						Insight is a web-based application, accessible only over a
						secure (HTTPS) connection. This ensures all data is encrypted while in transit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Insight’s primary infrastructure
						and your Customer Data is hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”), a global
						leader in Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”). We use AWS’s data centre in
						Ireland, ensuring that sensitive data remains stored within the EU.
					</p>
					<p>
						Insight’s primary server is replicated to a secondary
						database and is backed up daily to prevent data loss. Backups are securely
						stored in a separate location and are also password-protected.
					</p>
					<p>
						Amazon take physical and network security seriously. Their
						data centres are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly
						controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional
						security staff, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other
						electronic means. Access to their data centre floors requires two-factor
						authentication a minimum of two times. Our system access to the database is via
						a secure, password-protected, connection.
					</p>
					<p>
						Amazon maintain multiple
						certifications for its data centres, including
						<a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html"> ISO 27001 </a>
						compliance, PCI Certification, and SOC
						reports. Their reports can be found on the
						<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/"> AWS Compliance website </a>
						and you can read more about the
						specifics of their approach at
						<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of the Insight setup process, or by prior agreement to
						assist you in your ongoing use of Insight, you may choose to send us any
						Customer Data you’d like us to transfer into Insight on your behalf. You can
						send us data directly through Insight to ensure the highest levels of security.
						<b>Please do not send sensitive data as email attachments. </b>In this event,
						documents you upload to us are stored on our main servers within AWS.
						Authorized company employees may access this data for processing. Files we’re
						actively working on are stored temporarily on secure devices, for the duration
						of being processed.
					</p>
					<p>
						As described in our <a href="https://www.insighttracking.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, schools
						must provide each of their Authorised Users with their own access to Insight
						via an email address and password. Commonly used passwords which are known to
						have been previously leaked will be refused, to help ensure that secure
						passwords are chosen. Passwords are stored in a hashed form. We cannot view
						your password – if you need to reset it, you will need to follow the password
						reset procedure. We do not force you to change your password on a regular
						basis, following guidance from the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry">
							National
							Cyber Security Centre
						</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will
						maintain strict procedures and take all reasonable steps to protect your
						personal information. That said, the transmission of information via the
						Internet is not completely secure and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the
						security of Customer Data inputted to Insight. Any inputting of Customer Data
						is at your own risk.
					</p>
					<h2>Changes to this Privacy Notice</h2>
					<p>
						We reserve the right to change this Notice from time to time
						as we add new services or features or in response to changes in the law or our
						commercial arrangements.
					</p>
					<p>
						This Notice was last updated on 09 October 2018 to include details of our newly appointed DPO and replaces any
						other Notice previously applicable from this date.
					</p>
					<h2>Questions</h2>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about this Notice, or require any
						further information, please contact Insight support via email at <a href="mailto:support@insighttracking.com">support@insighttracking.com</a>.
